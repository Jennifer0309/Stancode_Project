# Topic:Battle of Deepfake Diffusion vs. Recognition

Introduction:
Previous poster session ‘The Turing Eye’(SC201 Oct2023) used ResNet model to recognize AI images and real people images. 
They found out AI images from ‘Stable Diffusion’ were the hardest to recognize.
Our team is divided into two groups: the generation team, which uses 'Stable Diffusion' to generate test data and attempts to decrease accuracy by adjusting the images, 
and the recognition team, which uses the real images and 'Stable Diffusion’ image datasets to build an ensemble model with ResNet and EfficientNet.
We aim to find out which team performs better through adversarial learning.

Discussion and Conclusion:
Our battle is like GAN process. At first generation team created test data by ‘Stable Diffusion’, 
recognition team then made model to defend, finally generated team decrease the accuracy by  making new test data.
