TODO:
Keep drawing "two dots and one line" on the window
The detailed process is as follows:
The position of the odd number of clicks is the line's starting point.
At this time, a hollow circle with a radius of constant SIZE will be drawn with the mouse click position as the center of the circle;
the even number of click positions is the end point of this line.
The hollow circle will disappear, and a straight line will be drawn at this point.
