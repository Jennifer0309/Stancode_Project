# **SC001 - Programming Fundamentals**  
Assignments demonstrate proficiency in loops (`for`, `while`), conditionals (`if`, `and/or`), decomposition and comments, variable operations (`data type`, `assign`), function structures (`parameters`, `return`), input/output handling, string operations, file reading, memory management, image data processing, and basic computer vision techniques.

# **SC101 - Object-Oriented Programming & Algorithms**  
### **Phase 1 (Assignments 1-4): Object-Oriented Programming & Data Structures**  
Covers Python class construction (`constructor`, `attribute`, `method`), inheritance (`super class`, `sub class`, `import`), fundamental data structures (`list`, `stack`, `queue`, `dict`, `tuple`), advanced data structures (`priority queue`, `linked list`, `tree`), data processing, visualization, interactive UI (`tkinter`), and web scraping (`requests`, `bs4`).  

### **Phase 2 (Assignments 5-6): Algorithms**  
Focuses on recursion, depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and algorithmic problem-solving.
